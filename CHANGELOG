* Changed Authorization::ObligationScope#rebuild_join_options! [Brian Langenfeld]
  * If we're dealing with multiple obligations we have to check (i.e. ones that result in OR'd conditions), we now use :include instead of :joins for our generated scope.  This does seem like a kludge, but until ActiveRecord scopes support unions (for checking obligations individually and consolidating the results), we don't have much choice.  Something to revisit later, for sure.
